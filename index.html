            Hello, my name is Richard Dominguez and I am currently pursuing Cerritos' Cloud Computing certificate.
            Once completing certificate, I plan on getting a CS transfer degree. 
            While I am here, I plan to learn as much as I can about Computer Science/Engineering. 
            During my free time, I enjoy doing outdoor tings like cycling and hiking (maybe less hiking now that snakes and other animals are out). 
            Yes, I have attempted to teach myself HTML/CSS and DOM manipulation with JavaScript, but this is my first official course. 
            My goal for this course is to learn the most I can and enjoy this class. <em> (I might've put this in our introductions, too.) </em>

        <ol>
            <li>I like to go running or cycling.</li>
            <li>I like to read if it is gloomy outside. Currently starting <em>Dark Age</em> from the Red Rising Series.</li>
            <li>Go out and eat. I'm not picky, either.</li>
