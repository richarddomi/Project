            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> 
                Hello, my name is Richard Dominguez and I am currently pursuing Cerritos' Cloud Computing certificate.
                Once completing certificate, I plan on getting a CS transfer degree. 
                While I am here, I plan to learn as much as I can about Computer Science/Engineering. 
                During my free time, I enjoy doing outdoor tings like cycling and hiking (maybe less hiking now that snakes and other animals are out). 
                Yes, I have attempted to teach myself HTML/CSS and DOM manipulation with JavaScript, but this is my first official course. 
                My goal for this course is to learn the most I can and enjoy this class. <em> (I might've put this in our introductions, too.) </em>
